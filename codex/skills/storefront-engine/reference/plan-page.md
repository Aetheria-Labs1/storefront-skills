# Page Planning — Templates & Vocabulary

Reference material for Phase -1 planning. Load when generating a page plan.

## Template Search (ALWAYS do this first)

Before planning custom sections, search the template library for pre-built sections:

```
search_section_templates({ query: "<describe what you need>", section: "<type>", industry: "<vertical>", mood: "<mood>" })
```

Templates are conversion-proven, pixel-perfect, and faster than generating from scratch. Use them as the starting point — swap copy, images, and colors to match the brand kit.

**Available filters:** section (hero, social-proof, trust, faq, etc.), industry (beauty, fashion, supplements, food, home, tech), mood (clinical, editorial, bold, clean, neutral, minimal, warm).

## Animation Vocabulary

| Effect | CSS/JS | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `fade-up` | `@keyframes fadeUp` + IntersectionObserver | Default reveal — works everywhere |
| `fade-in` | `opacity 0→1` | Subtle element appearance |
| `scale-in` | `transform: scale(0.95)→1` | Cards, images on scroll |
| `slide-left` / `slide-right` | `translateX` | Before/after, comparison |
| `parallax` | `transform: translateY(calc(...))` on scroll | Hero backgrounds, lifestyle images |
| `sticky` | `position: sticky` | CTA bars, navigation |
| `reveal-on-scroll` | IntersectionObserver + class toggle | Any content section |
| `stagger` | `animation-delay: calc(index * 100ms)` | Grid items, feature lists |
| `counter` | JS number animation | Stats, social proof numbers |
| `none` | — | Trust bars, CTAs (instant credibility) |

**Rules:**
- Hero: `fade-up` on load (no scroll trigger — it's above fold)
- Trust bar: NO animation (instant credibility, never delayed)
- Content sections: `reveal-on-scroll` with `fade-up`
- Grids: `stagger` children
- Final CTA: NO animation (urgency = instant)
- Max 3 different animation types per page (visual coherence)

## Visual Rhythm Patterns

### Progressive Relaxation (recommended for landing pages)
```
Hero: TIGHT spacing, HIGH density, WARM colors
  ↓
Middle: MEDIUM spacing, balanced density, NEUTRAL colors
  ↓
End: GENEROUS spacing, LOW density, WARM colors (return to brand)
```

### Alternating Density (good for long pages)
```
Dense section → Spacious section → Dense → Spacious
(content-heavy) → (breathing room) → (content) → (breathe)
```

### Color Temperature Flow
- **Warm open** (brand primary in hero) → **Cool middle** (neutral backgrounds) → **Warm close** (brand primary in final CTA)
- Never put two warm-colored sections adjacent (visual fatigue)
- White/light sections between colored ones = "breathing room"

### Spacing Scale
- Between sections: `py-16` (mobile) / `py-24` (desktop) default
- Dense sections: `py-12` / `py-16`
- Spacious sections: `py-20` / `py-32`
- Hero: full viewport height or `min-h-[80vh]`

## Inter-Section Communication Patterns

### Narrative Structures

**Problem → Solution → Proof → Action** (classic landing page)
- Hero: State the desired outcome
- Section 2-3: Identify the pain, introduce the solution
- Section 4-6: Prove it works (reviews, data, before/after)
- Section 7+: Ask for the action

**Story Arc** (editorial, brand pages)
- Hook → Context → Rising tension → Climax (product) → Resolution (CTA)

**AIDA** (ad-driven traffic)
- Attention (hero) → Interest (benefits) → Desire (social proof) → Action (CTA)

### CTA Placement Strategy

| Page Type | CTA Count | Placement |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Landing | 3 | Hero, mid-page (after social proof), final section |
| PDP | 2 | BuyBox (hero), Sticky bar (scroll) |
| Homepage | 2-3 | Hero, featured products, newsletter |
| Collection | 1 | Each product card (implicit) |

**Rules:**
- First CTA: always above fold (hero)
- Never 2 CTAs visible simultaneously (except sticky + in-content)
- CTA copy escalates: "Learn More" → "See Results" → "Get Started" → "Buy Now"
- Final CTA: strongest urgency (scarcity, guarantee, bonus)

### Social Proof Distribution

- **Early** (section 2-3): Lightweight (star rating bar, "10,000+ customers", press logos)
- **Middle** (section 5-6): Heavy (full testimonials, before/after, video reviews)
- **Late** (before final CTA): Reinforcement (single powerful quote, guarantee badge)

Never cluster all social proof in one place — distribute it to answer doubts as they arise.

## Scroll Incentive Patterns

What makes users keep scrolling:
1. **Visual hooks** — partially visible next section (cut off image, peeking headline)
2. **Curiosity gaps** — "Here's what 10,000 customers discovered..."
3. **Progressive disclosure** — numbered steps (1/3 visible = "where's 2 and 3?")
4. **Contrast breaks** — dark section after light = "something new is starting"
5. **Micro-rewards** — animation triggers on scroll = dopamine
