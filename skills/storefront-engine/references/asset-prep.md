# Asset Pipeline — Multi-Source Visual Strategy

> **Compiled runtime reference:** any `data-island` or `data-props` snippets below are renderer output, not page source. For new pages, use `<lx-island>` with a JSON script child as defined in `source-format.md`, then call `lexsis_pages` with action `compile`.

> **Inputs:** A standalone asset brief or an existing page workspace
> **Outputs:** Verified permanent asset bindings
> **When to load:** During `/design-page` asset selection or an independent
> `/asset-prep` request.

## Decision Tree

```
Need an image or video for a section?
│
├─ lexsis_asset_library({ action: "search", args: { query, workspace_id, theme_id } })
│  → found good match?
│  ├─ YES → use it (free, on-brand)
│  └─ NO ↓
│
├─ Product shot needed?
│  ├─ YES → use real images from lexsis_catalog action list/get
│  └─ NO ↓
│
├─ What type of asset?
│  ├─ Static image (background, lifestyle, texture, composite)
│  │  └─ lexsis_drafts action asset_generate
│  │
│  ├─ Video (hero, demo, UGC-style)
│  │  └─ External MCP: HiggsField / Runway / Kling
│  │
│  ├─ Reference/mood imagery (competitor screenshots, inspiration)
│  │  └─ External MCP: Exa (web_search_exa)
│  │
│  ├─ Stock photography (realistic, non-AI look needed)
│  │  └─ External MCP: Unsplash / Pexels
│  │
│  └─ Specialized illustration (custom style beyond built-in)
│     └─ External MCP: OpenArt
│
└─ After sourcing → lexsis_asset_upload action import
```

## Built-In Tools (Lexsis AI MCP)

| Tool | What it does | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| `lexsis_asset_library` → `search` | Search workspace assets | Free |
| `lexsis_drafts` → `asset_generate` | Generate, composite, inpaint, or restyle | Credits |
| `lexsis_assets` → `view` | Verify an asset | Free |
| `lexsis_asset_upload` → `import` | Import URL, base64, attachments; with no source it opens the upload panel and the resulting asset id arrives in a user message | Free |

Ask the user whether they want to pick from the library before searching; an empty `query` browses and opens the asset picker (`Design asset selection:` carries `asset_ids` and `selection_order`). Pass `workspace_id` explicitly when multiple workspaces
are available and the selected `theme_id` whenever the discovered action
schema supports it.

See `design-enrichment.md` for detailed prompt patterns, style selection guide, compositing recipes, and HTML placement patterns.

## External MCPs (Detected at Runtime)

These tools are available when the user has the corresponding MCP installed. Check availability before suggesting.

### Exa — Image Research & Reference

```
web_search_exa({ query: "skincare brand hero photography editorial style" })
```

Use for: mood boards, competitor visual research, finding reference imagery to brief `lexsis_drafts` action `asset_generate` more precisely, sourcing real lifestyle photos.

**Flow:** Exa search → find URL → `lexsis_asset_upload` action `import` → use
the returned permanent URL.

### HiggsField / Runway / Kling — Video Generation

Use when: TikTok traffic source, fashion/luxury vertical, product demo needed, brand has no existing video content.

**Flow:**
1. Generate video via external MCP (short clip, 3-8 seconds)
2. `lexsis_campaigns.frames` → pull best frame as thumbnail
3. Use video URL in HeroMedia island or `<video>` tag
4. Set click-to-play (NEVER autoplay — costs 7% CVR)

**Video placement patterns:**
- Hero: click-to-play with compelling thumbnail image
- Product demo: inline player after benefits section
- Social proof: UGC-style video carousel
- Background: muted loop, heavily dimmed (luxury only)

### OpenArt — Specialized AI Illustration

Use when: `lexsis_drafts(action: "asset_generate", args: style: "illustration")` doesn't provide enough control over style, need specific artistic direction, or brand has a custom illustration language.

### Unsplash / Pexels — Stock Photography

Use when: brand has no library assets, AI generation looks too synthetic, need real-world photography (locations, hands, diverse models).

## Feeding External Assets Into Pages

All external assets MUST be persisted before use:

```
1. Source asset via external MCP → get URL
2. lexsis_asset_upload({
     action: "import",
     args: { url, purpose: "hero_bg", tags: ["lifestyle", "summer"], workspace_id, theme_id }
   })
   → returns { asset_id, url, width, height }
3. Use returned URL in page HTML (same as built-in assets)
```

This ensures: the asset is stored in the brand's library, available for reuse, and won't break if the external source goes down.

## Per-Page-Type Asset Budget

| Page Type | Hero (high) | Supporting imagery (medium) | Lifestyle (medium) | Video | Total assets |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|----|------|
| PDP | 1 | 0-1 | 1 | 0-1 | 2-4 |
| Landing | 1 | 2-3 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 3-5 |
| Homepage | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| Editorial | 1 | 3-4 | 2-3 | 0-1 | 6-9 |
| Collection | 0-1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0-1 |
| Bundle | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2-3 |

**Rules:**
- Check `lexsis_workspace` action `credits` before generation
- Use `quality: "medium"` default; `"high"` only for hero images
- Products have their own Shopify images — never generate product shots

---

## Video in Pages

### When Video Converts Better
- TikTok/Reels traffic (video-native audience)
- Fashion/beauty (texture, movement, try-on)
- Luxury (cinematic brand storytelling)
- Product demos (85% say video convinced them to buy)

### Technical Integration
```html
<!-- Click-to-play video hero -->
<lx-island name="HeroMedia">
  <script type="application/json">
    { "type": "video", "videoSrc": "VIDEO_URL", "poster": "THUMBNAIL_URL", "autoplay": false }
  </script>
</lx-island>

<!-- Inline video (no island needed for simple playback) -->
<video class="w-full rounded-xl" poster="THUMBNAIL_URL" controls playsinline>
  <source src="VIDEO_URL" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

### Anti-Patterns
- NEVER autoplay video (-7% CVR)
- NEVER use video as only hero content (needs fallback image)
- NEVER serve uncompressed video; use the imported CDN URL

## Compact Asset Record

After sourcing, update `page-manifest.json` and return:

```json
{
  "role": "hero",
  "sectionId": "hero",
  "sourceType": "lexsis",
  "assetId": "asset-uuid",
  "url": "https://cdn.trylexsis.com/assets/abc123.jpg",
  "status": "verified"
}
```

Shopify catalog media uses `sourceType: "shopify"` with `productId` and
`mediaId` instead of `assetId`. Never require a Lexsis asset ID for a Shopify
image.

Keep crop guidance, alt-text intent, prompts, and creative reasoning in the
plan or standalone asset brief. Asset names alone do not establish identity.
Visually inspect product, creator, and endorsement imagery. Generation uses
only permanent verified URLs.

---

## Cost Control

1. `lexsis_asset_library` action `search` first
2. `lexsis_workspace` action `credits` before expensive operations
3. Prefer `quality: "medium"` — reserve `"high"` for hero only
4. External MCP assets → `lexsis_asset_upload` action `import`
5. The page background for sections that don't need imagery
6. Reuse: one hero image can serve as dimmed background for 2-3 sections
